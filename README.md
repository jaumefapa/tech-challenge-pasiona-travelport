## Tech challenge Pasiona-Travelport

- I took 90 min to write this code.
- I did not take into account the time setting up the project and removing React boilerplate

## Given time constraints I have not:

- Concerning testing all the commented tests should be wrapped inside a 'describe' an each one should be a 'test'
- It would been nice to do some snapshot tests by mocking data
- The user can not modify the todos but he/she can delete them
